# Single Linked List - LMPTHW
This is a single linked list that I created as part of the Learn More Python The Hard Way exercises.

Running the SLL.py script, you can create your own single linked list and perform a number of operations on it.

If you wish to run the tests, the test file requires pytest to run.
