# Double Linked List - LMPTHW
This is a double linked list that I created as part of the Learn More Python The Hard Way exercises.

Running the DLL.py script, you can create your own double linked list and perform a number of operations on it.

If you wish to run the tests, the test file requires pytest to run.
